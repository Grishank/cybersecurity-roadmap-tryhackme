# 🐧 Linux Fundamentals (Module Completed – All 3 Parts ✅)

The Linux Fundamentals module builds a strong foundation for working with the Linux operating system — the backbone of servers, cybersecurity labs, cloud systems, DevOps tools, and penetration testing environments.

Across all 3 rooms, this module helps you build confidence with:
- Terminal navigation & file interaction  
- Command flags & switches  
- Searching tools (`find`, `grep`)  
- Permissions, users, groups  
- Processes, logs, and automation  
- Package management & system maintenance  
- Text editors (nano) and useful utilities
