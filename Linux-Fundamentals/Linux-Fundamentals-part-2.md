Status: ✅ Completed

🧠 What I Learned
🔹 1. Flags, Switches & Command Behavior

Learned how commands change behavior using flags.

Examples:

ls -l, ls -a

cd -

cp -r

Understood how almost every Linux command has optional switches.

🔹 2. Filesystem Interaction Continued

Reading, copying, moving, and deleting files.

Working with directories using commands like:

mkdir, rmdir, rm -r, touch, mv

Learned how to read file contents using cat, less, head, tail.

🔹 3. Permissions 101

Understood Unix-style permissions:

r (read), w (write), x (execute)

Learned numeric permission values (chmod):

chmod 755, chmod 644

Understood owner, group, and others.

Important for security → prevents unauthorized access.

🔹 4. Common Directories

Explored important Linux filesystem directories like:

/etc/ → configurations

/var/ → logs

/bin/ → binaries

/home/ → user files

/tmp/ → temporary data

/opt/ → optional packages

Understanding these helps during incident response and pentesting.

🧩 Key Concepts Strengthened

Proper use of flags & switches

Assigning/modifying file permissions

Identifying directory purpose in Linux

Secure file operations

Real-world Linux usage in cybersecurity
