### 🧠 What I Learned
- How to access a Linux machine remotely using **SSH**.  
- How to use **flags and switches** to modify command behavior (`ls -l`, `ls -a`, etc.).  
- Deeper filesystem interaction:  
  - copying files  
  - moving files  
  - deleting files  
- Learned what **permissions** mean (read, write, execute).  
- Learned to identify **users, groups, and roles** in Linux.  
- Understood the purpose of **common directories** like `/etc`, `/bin`, `/var`, `/home`, `/tmp`.

### 🧩 Key Concepts
- SSH lets you log into remote machines securely.  
- Flags provide extra functionality to commands.  
- Permissions control which users can read, write, or execute files.  
- Linux uses a structured hierarchy with important directories for configuration, binaries, logs, and temporary data.  
- Part 2 builds confidence in navigating and controlling deeper levels of the Linux system.
