### 🧠 What I Learned
- Learned how to **remotely access Linux machines using SSH**, which is the most common method used by sysadmins, developers, and pentesters to control servers.
- Developed a strong understanding of **flags and switches**:
  - `ls -a` → show hidden files  
  - `ls -l` → show permissions + ownership  
  - `ls -la` → combine both  
  Flags are essential for customizing commands and revealing system details.
- Continued filesystem interaction at a deeper level:
  - Copying files with `cp`  
  - Moving or renaming files with `mv`  
  - Removing files/folders safely  
  - Understanding the importance of structure in Linux systems  
  These are daily-use operations for both SOC analysts and Linux administrators.
- Gained a clear foundation in **Linux permissions**:
  - Read (`r`), Write (`w`), Execute (`x`)  
  - Permissions for **user**, **group**, **others**  
  - How Linux secures files with permission rules  
  This is critical for understanding access control and security hardening.
- Learned the role of **common system directories**:
  - `/etc` → configuration files  
  - `/var` → logs & variable data  
  - `/bin` → essential binaries  
  - `/home` → user home directories  
  - `/tmp` → temporary files used by programs  
  Each directory has a specialized purpose in system management and incident response.
- Understood how Part 2 expands your ability to *control system behavior*, not just navigate it.

### 🧩 Key Concepts
- SSH provides secure remote access — a core skill for cybersecurity labs and real servers.  
- Flags help you extract more information from commands and work efficiently.  
- Permissions form the foundation of Linux security and privilege boundaries.  
- Understanding system directories is essential for log analysis and investigations.  
- Part 2 focuses on making you comfortable managing files, access, and system structure like a professional.
