## 🧠 What I Learned

### 🔹 1. Introduction
- This part focused on **Windows Security**, which is crucial for SOC Analysts.
- Learned how Windows defends against threats internally.

---

### 🔹 2. Windows Updates
- Understood how updates deliver:
  - Security patches  
  - Bug fixes  
  - Vulnerability mitigations  
- Attackers often exploit unpatched systems → SOC must track this.

---

### 🔹 3. Windows Security (Defender)
- Learned the structure of **Windows Defender Security Center**:
  - Virus & threat protection  
  - Account protection  
  - Firewall settings  
  - Device security  
- Defender is powerful and commonly used in enterprises.

---

### 🔹 4. Virus & Threat Protection
- Learned how Defender performs:
  - Real-time scanning  
  - Controlled folder access  
  - Signature updates  
- Analysts use this to detect:
  - Malware executables  
  - Suspicious downloads  
  - Ransomware behaviors  

---

### 🔹 5. Firewall & Network Protection
- Understood how Windows Firewall manages:
  - Inbound/outbound rules  
  - Blocked ports  
  - Allowed apps  
- Attackers often:
  - Disable firewall  
  - Create new rules  
  - Whitelist malicious apps  

---

### 🔹 6. App & Browser Control
- Controls Exploit Protection features:
  - SmartScreen  
  - Reputation-based blocking  
  - Memory integrity  
- Helps block:
  - Drive-by downloads  
  - Malicious scripts  
  - Untrusted apps  

---

### 🔹 7. Device Security
- Covers:
  - Hardware security  
  - Secure boot  
  - TPM  
- Important for preventing rootkits and firmware-level attacks.

---

### 🔹 8. BitLocker
- Learned encryption basics.
- BitLocker protects:
  - Drives  
  - Partitions  
- SOC uses it to ensure stolen laptops don’t leak data.

---

### 🔹 9. Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS)
- Learned how Windows stores **Shadow Copies** of files.
- VSS is crucial because:
  - It allows file recovery  
  - Ransomware often deletes shadow copies  
- Analysts check Shadow Copy status during ransomware investigations.

---

## ⚙️ Key Takeaways

> “Windows security isn’t just antivirus — it’s a full ecosystem of protections from updates to encryption.”

- Defender is a strong, built-in antivirus  
- Windows Firewall is essential for network defense  
- BitLocker protects data even if hardware is stolen  
- VSS helps recover files after ransomware attacks
