## 🐧 Module 2 — Linux Fundamentals

This module teaches the core concepts of Linux, navigation, permissions, essential commands, and system management — critical for every SOC analyst and ethical hacker.

### **Completed Rooms:**
- [Linux Fundamentals — Part 1](../Linux-Fundamentals/Linux-Fundamentals-part-1.md)  
- [Linux Fundamentals — Part 2](../Linux-Fundamentals/Linux-Fundamentals-part-2.md)  
- [Linux Fundamentals — Part 3](../Linux-Fundamentals/Linux-Fundamentals-part-3.md)

**Note:**  
These rooms were previously completed in the *Pre-Security Path* and fully documented in the dedicated Linux-Fundamentals module.  
They are referenced here to accurately map Cybersecurity 101 progression without duplicating content.

## 🪟 Module 3 — Windows & AD Fundamentals

This module covers Windows operating system basics, enterprise authentication concepts, and Active Directory — the backbone of identity management in most organizations.

### **Completed Rooms:**

#### **🔹 Windows Fundamentals (Completed Earlier — Linked)**  
- [Windows Fundamentals — Part 1](../Windows-Fundamentals/Part-1.md)  
- [Windows Fundamentals — Part 2](../Windows-Fundamentals/Part-2.md)  
- [Windows Fundamentals — Part 3](../Windows-Fundamentals/Part-3.md)

#### **🔹 Active Directory Basics (New Room in This Path)**  
- [Active Directory Basics](./Windows%20and%20Ad%20Fundamentals/Active-Directory-Basics.md)

**Note:**  
Windows Fundamentals 1, 2, and 3 were completed during the *Pre-Security Path* and are linked here for Cybersecurity 101 path completeness.  
Active Directory Basics is a new room specific to this path and is stored in the module folder.

## 💻 Module 4 — Command Line Fundamentals

This module focuses on mastering the **command-line interface (CLI)** and shell environments — critical skills for SOC analysts, incident responders, and defenders.  
It emphasizes speed, automation, scripting, and investigation across Windows and Linux systems.

### **Completed Rooms:**
- [Windows Command Line](./Command-Line/Windows-command-line.md)  
- [Windows PowerShell](./Command-Line/Windows-Powershell.md)  
- [Linux Shells](./Command-Line/Linux-Shells.md)

**Why this matters for SOC:**  
Command-line, PowerShell, and shell activity are heavily used during system administration *and* post-exploitation.  
Understanding normal shell behavior helps SOC analysts detect suspicious commands, scripts, privilege escalation attempts, and living-off-the-land attacks.

## 🌐 Module 5 — Networking Fundamentals

This module introduces the core networking concepts required for understanding how systems communicate and how attacks move across networks.

### **Completed Rooms:**
- [Networking Concepts](./Networking/Networking-Concepts.md)

**Why this matters for SOC:**  
Most attacks involve network activity. Understanding OSI layers, IP addressing, protocols, and encapsulation helps SOC analysts detect, triage, and investigate network-based threats effectively.
