# 🌐 Networking Fundamentals (Module Completed – All 5 Rooms ✅)

The Networking Fundamentals module provides the essential knowledge required to understand how data moves across networks — a critical skill for cybersecurity, SOC analysis, digital forensics, penetration testing, and cloud security.

This module builds strong foundations in:
- Network topologies & LAN concepts  
- OSI Model (7 Layers)  
- Packets, frames & how data is encapsulated  
- TCP/IP communication (3-way handshake)  
- UDP, ports, and protocols  
- Firewalls, VPNs, and network devices  
- IP addressing, subnetting, ARP & DHCP  
- Port forwarding and secure network design

## 🧩 Rooms Completed

### 1️⃣ [`Intro to LAN`](./Intro-to-LAN.md)
Learned foundational LAN concepts:
- LAN topologies (star, bus, ring, hybrid)  
- Subnetting basics & CIDR  
- ARP and how MAC addresses are resolved  
- DHCP workflow (DORA: Discover → Offer → Request → ACK)  
- OSI layer mapping to real-world operations  

---

### 2️⃣ [`OSI Model`](./OSI-model.md)
Gained a deep understanding of:
- All **7 layers** of the OSI Model  
- Frames vs packets vs segments  
- How encryption, routing, switching, and protocols fit into layers  
- SOC correlations: which attacks occur at what layer  
- Completed practical OSI mapping game  

---

### 3️⃣ [`Packets and Frames`](./Packets-and-Frames.md)
Understood data encapsulation & transport:
- What frames (L2) and packets (L3) look like  
- TCP/IP 3-way handshake (SYN → SYN/ACK → ACK)  
- UDP/IP characteristics  
- Ports 101 (common service ports)  
- Practical handshake simulation  

---

### 4️⃣ [`Extending Your Network`](./Extending-your-network.md)
Learned network expansion and protection concepts:
- Port forwarding & NAT exposure  
- Firewall types and rule design  
- VPN tunneling and encryption  
- LAN networking devices (routers, switches, APs, modems)  
- Practical network simulator exercises  

---

### 5️⃣ [`What is Networking?`](../networking-fundamentals.md)  
*(First basic room from Pre-Security, listed here for completeness)*  
Covered:
- OSI basics  
- IP addressing  
- Ports & protocols  
- Basic troubleshooting (ping, traceroute)
