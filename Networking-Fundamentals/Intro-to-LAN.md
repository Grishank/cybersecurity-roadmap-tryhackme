### 🧠 What I Learned

#### 🔹 1. LAN Topologies  
- Understood physical and logical layouts of networks.  
- Models covered:  
  - **Star Topology**  
  - **Bus Topology**  
  - **Ring Topology**  
  - **Hybrid Networks**  
- Learned how different topologies impact **network performance**, fault tolerance, and scalability.

#### 🔹 2. Subnetting Basics  
- Understood why subnetting is used to divide networks efficiently.  
- Learned how subnet masks determine the number of hosts in a network.  
- Practiced converting between **CIDR notation** and subnet masks.  
- Understood how subnetting helps in:  
  - Reducing broadcast domains  
  - Improving network security  
  - Better traffic segmentation  

#### 🔹 3. ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)  
- Learned how ARP maps **IP addresses → MAC addresses**.  
- Explored how devices discover each other on a LAN.  
- Understood ARP tables and ARP broadcasts.  
- Learned why ARP is vulnerable to attacks like **ARP poisoning** (MITM).

#### 🔹 4. DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)  
- Learned how devices receive IP addresses automatically.  
- Understood DHCP roles:  
  - **Discovery → Offer → Request → Acknowledgment**  
- Understood how DHCP assigns:  
  - IP address  
  - Subnet mask  
  - Default gateway  
  - DNS servers

### ⚙️ Key Takeaways
> “LANs are the foundation of every network — understanding them makes all higher-level networking concepts easier.”
