### 🧠 What I Learned
- Understood **what DNS (Domain Name System)** is and how it converts human-readable domains into IP addresses.  
- Learned about the **Domain Hierarchy** — Root servers, TLD servers (like `.com`, `.org`), and Authoritative Name Servers.  
- Explored different **DNS Record Types**, including:  
  - `A` / `AAAA` → IP address mapping  
  - `CNAME` → canonical (alias) names  
  - `MX` → mail exchange records  
  - `NS` → name servers  
  - `TXT` → SPF / DKIM / verification entries  
- Practiced **making DNS queries** with tools like `nslookup` and `dig`.  
- Understood the **DNS resolution process** from client request → resolver → root → TLD → authoritative server → response.  
- Explored how **attackers misuse DNS** for information gathering, subdomain enumeration, and redirection attacks.
